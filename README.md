# Python 101

#### Part 1: _Variables_
What is a variable? Techtarget.com says:
> In programming, a variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program.

In order to utilize variables, you need to first assign it, then use it. To assign a variable, first
you need to set the variable name. Then have an equal sign, followed by the value you want the variable to be.

###### Note: Python automatically formats variables into integers or strings. You don't need to do an formatting on your part.

Here's an example:
```
a = "Hello, World!"
var1 = 1
var2 = 10
```
The first variable was a string, and the last two are integers. The main types of variables are:
* Boolean
  * True or False
* Integer
  * A positive or negative number
  * Whole numbers _ONLY_.
* String
  * Text
* Floating Point
  * A number with decimals

To use a variable, simply call it with the same name you assigned it as.
Two examples are:
Printing variables:
`print a`
Doing math functions with variables:
`var3 = var1 % 4`
`var4 = var1 * var2 - var3`

#### Part 2: _Conditions_



#### Part 3: _Functions_

Functions are the bits of code that you use to store lines of code and call them. You can assign variables or arguments to a function by putting them into parenthesis.
You can do math, set variables, return values, and print statements with functions. You can also have if-then statements within functions.
The syntax looks like this:
```
def function_1(a, b):
  if a == b:
    return "Nope"

  else: return c = a + b

```
